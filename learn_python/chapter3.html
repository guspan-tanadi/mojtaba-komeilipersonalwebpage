    </div>
    <p>
      Having tried to build our simple game, you might have noticed that perhpas the hardest part was
      planning the functions that you need and how to connect pieces of your code.
      This is always a critical step in programming,
      and becomes extraordinarily hard for larger and more complext programs.
      A very interesting approach in programming that helps us think better about our programs
      and build them easier is called <strong>Object Oriented Porgramming</strong>.
      In this chapter we see how we can build our game a lot easier with objects that we are building <i>and</i>
      even use some objects that are built by others.
    </p>
    <h2>Think Objects</h2>
    <p>
      What is an object? Objects in programming are very similar to objects we have in real world.
      We define each object with two thigns:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Properties</strong>: how it is and looks like. For example color, size, location, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Actions</strong>: what it can do. For example runs, moves, eats, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box">
      Find an object around you and try to find its <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>actions</strong>.
    </div>

    <h3>Building a car object</h3>
    <p>
      Let's imagine a car. If you wanted to define a car in your program as an object,
      what do you think the <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>actions</strong> for a car would be?
      Of course there are thousands of things that a car can do (move, stop, turn, play music, heat up seats, etc.)
      and plenty of properties a car has (color, make, number of bolts, amount of gas, etc.).
      But the important thing to remember for bringing it as an object to your program is
      <strong>which of those thousands of properties and actions are what you need in your program.</strong>
      You only need to choose things that your program needs. We will talk a bit more about that in a bit.
      For example, for a simple program, your car objects may only need these:
    <ul>
      <li>Properties:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>make</li>
        <li>color</li>
        <li>speed</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Actions:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>accelerate</li>
        <li>brake</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    For showing this easier programmers usually use images like this.
    </p>
    <h1 style="color:red;">FIGURE 1 HERE</h1>
    <p>
      Now try to figure out the objects that we need for our simple game and properties and actions that they have.
      Two objects that we definitely need are our game <strong>hero</strong> and <strong>deamon</strong>.
      Using the same diagrams we used for the car, we can have these for our hero and deamon character,
      when we are building them into objects in our program.
    </p>
    <h1 style="color:red;">FIGURE 2 HERE</h1>

    <h2>Objects in python</h2>

    <!-- Classes -->
    <h3>Class</h3>
    <p>
    <h1 style="color:red;">FIGURE 3 HERE</h1>
    Python uses <strong>classes</strong> to create an object.
    A class is like a blueprint to create something. You give this blueprint to Python and creates an objects for you
    exactly as you asked.
    For example this is how we define a car class that has a single action, move, in Python.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Defining a car class in Python
class Car:
  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')
</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this code we have <span class="inline-code">class Car</span> which tells Python we are about to define a class.
      The block of code (remember tabs) that comes after this line is the definition of this class.
      In this block we have a function called <span class="inline-code">move</span>.
      It is a simple function that just prints "The car is moving.".
      Functions that define actions for an objects <strong>MUST</strong> have <span class="inline-code">self</span> as
      their first parameter.
      It is very important that you remember this.
    </p>

    <!-- Classes -->
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Now that we have a class, we can use it to create and object.
      In other words, now that we told Python how our <span class="inline-code">Car</span> object looks like,
      we are going to tell python to create it for us.
      You can simply create an object from you class by callig your class like a function: <span
        class="inline-code">my_car = Car()</span>.
      <strong>The variable that this returns</strong>, <span class="inline-code">my_car</span>, <strong>is your
        object.</strong>.
      Now, you can call actions (functions) from your object by using a "." after your object and then the name of the
      action you want.
      When calling the functions from an object, Python will put the value of <span class="inline-code">self</span>
      inside your function;
      you should <strong>NOT</strong> do it yourself.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Calling actions/functions from an object.
class Car:
  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')

# Creating an object using Car class and storing it in a variable
my_car = Car()
# Now we have an object called my_car

# Calling the move function from my_car object
my_car.move()
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Save a file, for example name it <i>cars.py</i>,
      with the code on your file and run it this is the output when you run this Python code:
    </p>
    <div class="output-box">
      The car is moving.
    </div>
    <h3>The <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function</h3>
    <p>
      The most important function in every object is its <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function.
      Every class in Pyhton has an <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function.
      If you don't add it yourself, like we did with the car class here, Python will add that for you when it runs your
      code.
      You saw that when you want to create an object you call its class name,
      for example <span class="inline-code">my_car = Car()</span> to create a
      <span class="inline-code">my_car</span> object from the <span class="inline-code">Car</span> class.
      When Python is creating your object, it first runs the <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function for its
      class.
      In fact, we call this function <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> which is the short form for
      <strong>initialize</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the times Python programmers use <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function to add properties to
      their objects.
      Think about it this way: <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function is where you tell Python how your
      object is
      going to look like right after it was created. Properties in an object are like variables but we put a
      <span class="inline-code">self.</span> in front of their names to say that they belong to that object.
      For example this this is how we make a <i>red ford</i> car object in Python.
      As you can see it also has the <span class="inline-code">self.</span> function.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Defining a Red Ford car object
class Car:
  def __init__(self):
    self.make = 'Ford'
    self.color = 'red'

  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')
</code></pre>

    <p>
      The properties of an obejct are like any other variable. But you <stron>MUST</stron> have the object name in front
      of them.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Properties of an object
class Car:
  def __init__(self):
    self.make = 'Ford'
    self.color = 'red'

  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')
  
my_car = Car()
print('My car is made by ' + my_car.make)
print('The color of my car is ' + my_car.color)
</code></pre>
    <p>And the output of this is</p>
    <div class="output-box">
      My car is made by Ford
      <br>
      The color of my car is red
    </div>

    <p>
      So far our <span class="inline-code">Car</span> class has been always creating one type of car: red Ford.
      But how do we make it to create other types of cars? The answer is usign the <span
        class="inline-code">__init__</span> function.
      As we said, <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function is just a function that belongs to our object.
      Its first variable is <span class="inline-code">self</span> (which we don't usually thouch), but we can have other
      variables to it.
      For example
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Properties of an object
class Car:
  def __init__(self, make, color):
    self.make = make
    self.color = color

    # Finding out the country it was made baseon on its maker.
    if make == 'Ford' || make == 'GM':
      self.made_in = 'US'
    elif make == 'Honda' || make == 'Toyota':
      self.made_in = 'Japan'
    elif make == 'BMW':
      self.made_in = 'Germany'
    else:
    self.made_in = '???'

  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')
  
# Creating an object for my car
my_car = Car('Ford', 'red')
print('My car is made by ' + my_car.make)
print('The color of my car is ' + my_car.color)
print('My car is made in ' + my_car.made_in)

print('---------')

# Creating an object for your car
your_car = Car('Honda', 'black')
print('Your car is made by ' + my_car.make)
print('The color of your car is ' + my_car.color)
print('Your car is made in ' + my_car.made_in)
</code></pre>
    <div class="output-box">
      My car is made by Ford
      <br>
      The color of my car is red
      <br>
      My car is made in US
      <br>
      ---------
      <br>
      Your car is made by Honda
      <br>
      The color of your car is black
      <br>
      Your car is made in Japan
    </div>

    <p>
      You can also read and change the values of the properties from inside the functions of a class.
      Just do not forget that you need to have <span class="inline-code">self.</span> in front of the
      variables that keep the properties of an object.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># A car that accelerates and brakes.
class Car:
  def __init__(self):
    # We set the initial speed to 0
    # because the car was just created and doesn't move.
    self.speed = 0

  def accelerate(self):
    self.speed = self.speed + 1
    print('Car accelerated to the new speed ', self.speed)
  
  def brake(self):
    if self.speed < 1:
      print('The car has stopped. No more braking.')
    else:
    self.speed = self.speed - 1
    print('Car reduced its speed to ', self.speed)
  
# Creating an object for the car
some_car = Car()

# Calling accelerate 3 times.
for i in range(3):
  some_car.accelerate()

# Calling brake 5 times.
for i in range(5):
  some_car.brake()
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      Car accelerated to the new speed 1
      <br>
      Car accelerated to the new speed 2
      <br>
      Car accelerated to the new speed 3
      <br>
      Car reduced its speed to 2
      <br>
      Car reduced its speed to 1
      <br>
      Car reduced its speed to 0
      <br>
      The car has stopped. No more braking.
