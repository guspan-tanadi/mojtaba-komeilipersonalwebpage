      please try it before continuing the rest of this chapter.

    <p>
      Having tried to build our simple game, you might have noticed that perhpas the hardest part was
      planning the functions that you need and how to connect pieces of your code.
      This is always a critical step in programming,
      and becomes extraordinarily hard for larger and more complext programs.
      A very interesting approach in programming that helps us think better about our programs
      and build them easier is called <strong>Object Oriented Porgramming</strong>.
      In this chapter we see how we can build our game a lot easier with objects that we are building <i>and</i>
      even use some objects that are built by others.
    </p>
    <h2>Think Objects</h2>
    <p>
      What is an object? Objects in programming are very similar to objects we have in real world.
      We define each object with two thigns:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Properties</strong>: how it is and looks like. For example color, size, location, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Actions</strong>: what it can do. For example runs, moves, eats, etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="box">
      Find an object around you and try to find its <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>actions</strong>.
