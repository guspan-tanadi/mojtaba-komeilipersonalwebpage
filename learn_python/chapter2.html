      <h1>Branches</h1>
      <p>
        Often in a program it happens that the <strong>flow</strong> of your program depends on certain conditions.
        This is where branches come in.
      </p>
      
      <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter2/branches.jpeg" width="60%" class="image">
      <p>
        Branches are also known as the <span class="inline-code">if-else</span> conditions, because that's literally what happens in branching:
        A branch is a point in a program where there is a decision to make, based on which the flow of the program will be determined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a program that asks for your age and then tells you how old you are
        (not very useful, I know, but bare will me a bit).
        The code for such program will be something like this:
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># A program that tells you how old you are, but asks you that first.
age = input('How old are you? ')
print('You are ' + age + ' years olds.')
print('Have a nice day. Bye!')</code></pre>
      
      <p>
        Python will read your program line by line and executes each line.
        So, this is how your program <strong>flow</strong> look likes:
      </p>
      
      <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter2/straight-flow.png" width="70%" class="image">
      
      <h2>Change of flow</h2>
      <p>
        Now let's turn this into a program that does something slightly more useful:
        It asks your age, and then it tells you if you are eligible to vote
        (let's assume the legal age for voting is 18).
        Obviously we need something that has two separate paths.
        One of them tells you "Yes, you are" <i>if</i> the age you typed in is more than 18,
        and the other one that tells you "No, you aren't" otherwise.
      </p>
      
      <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter2/conditioned-flow.png" width="70%" class="image">
      
      <p>
        As you can see in the image above there are two flows for the program.
        Here is where the <strong>conditional statements</strong> come in.
        Conditional statemenet depend on an <i>statement</i> being <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>.
        In Python, as in other porgramming languages,
        we use the methematical equality and inequality signs to make these statemenets.
        The proper way to read the mathematical expressions made from the above is through using them with this table.
      </p>
      <div>
        <table style="width:50%">
          <tr>
            <th>Symbol</th>
            <th>Meaning</th> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> == </td>
            <td>Equal</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> != </td>
            <td>NOT Equal</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> > </td>
            <td>Greater than</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> => </td>
            <td>Greater than or equal</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> < </td>
            <td>Less than</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> =< </td>
            <td>Less than or equal</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        For example, we read <span class="inline-code">7 > 32</span> like this: "7 is greater than 32".
        Obviously, this is not correct, whic mean that this statement is <span class="inline-code">False</span>.
        Try this in Python as see if it agrees:
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Logical statements in Python
print(7 > 32)</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Boolean</h2>
      <p>
        Remember the variables that we introdued before?
        There is another VERY important variable type called <strong>boolean</strong>.
        Booleans can only take two values <span class="inline-code">False</span> or <span class="inline-code">True</span>.
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Boolean values
BooleanValue = True
print(BooleanValue)</code></pre>
      
      <p>
        As you may imagine there is not much appeal in having boolean variables on their own.
        But their importance becomse clear when we go back to the conditional statements that we talked about.
        In fact, what changes the flow of a program is often a boolean variable being
        <span class="inline-code">False</span> or <span class="inline-code">True</span>.
        Try to see if you can figure out what this code will print:
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">B1 = 7 > 9
print(B1)

print(4 != 6)

# Remember the use of brackets from the last lession?
B2 = (7 - (5 * 2)) == ((5 * 3) - 4)
print(B2)

B3 = "Something" == "something"
print(B3)
</code></pre>
      
      
      <h2>If condition</h2>
      <p>
        Now it is time to introduce one of our most important concepts in programming: <strong>if blocks</strong>.
        Using keyword <span class="inline-code">if</span> in Python, you will tell your program to run a piece of your program
        only <i>if</i> a condition is true. Here is where we use the power of boolean variables.
        Python will look at the boolean variables (or an statement that can have a boolean value) and if it was
        <span class="inline-code">True</span>, it will run the <strong>block of code</strong> after the <span class="inline-code">if</span>.
        Otherwise it will ignore the block of code, and continues with the code afetr that block.
      </p>
      <h3>What is a <strong>block of code</strong>?</h3>
      <p>
        A block of code, is any piece of program. It can be a single line of code or a few thousand lines.
        Having separate blocks of code, helps us tell python to run a block or not, depending on a boolean value.
        The first block of code that we are going to work with here is the block of code that belongs to an if branch.
        This is how we use the if condition and its block in Python
        (notice the <span class="inline-code">:</span> after the boolean condition, we always need that):
      </p>
      <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter2/if-block.png" width="70%" class="image">
      <p>
        Here we have a boolean statement, that can be <span class="inline-code">True</span> or <span class="inline-code">False</span>,
        in front of an <span class="inline-code">if</span>. This is the <span class="inline-code">A > 20</span>.
        Then, right after that there are two lines of code that have <strong>tab</strong> space in front of them.
        All this area with tab in front of it is what we call the <strong>if block</strong>.
        Python will run this code if and only if during running the program the boolean condition in front of <span class="inline-code">if</span> was <span class="inline-code">True</span>, otherwise it completely ignore it.
        Knowing this try to predict what happens when we run this program.
      </p>
      <p>
        It happens a lot in programming that we want to run a block of code if something was true,
        and another block of code otherwise. We can have this with 2 separate if blocks that have the opposite if each other.
        But, because this is very common, programming langauges already have something for use.
        All we need to do is adding <span class="inline-code">else</span> right after our if block finishes,
        and adding a block of code.
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># if block with else condition
a = input('Insert a number: ')
num = int(a)

if a > 20:
  # This is the block of code that will run if the boolean condition was True
  print('Your number was more than 20')
else:
  # This is the block of code that will run if the boolean condition was False
  print('Your number was not more than 20')
</code></pre>
      
      <div class="box">
        Now you must be ready to write the code for the age checking program we talked about above. Try it!
      </div>
      
      <h2>Multiple conditions</h2>
      It may also happen that you need to check something for multiple conditions.
      For example, if you want to check if number is between 1-5, or 6-10, or 11-20, etc.
      This may need manye if else branches, or a shorter way in Python is using <span class="inline-code">elif</span>,
      which is short of <i>else if</i>. You can have as many <span class="inline-code">elif</span>s that you want afetr an
      <span class="inline-code">if</span> condition to check for various other things that may happen.
      Remember that each of those need a block of code for its own flow.
      Example:
<pre><code class="language-python"># if block with else condition
a = input('Insert a number: ')
num = int(a)

if a > 30:
  print('Your number was more than 30')
elif a > 20:
  print('Your number was more than 20')
elif a > 10:
  print('Your number was more than 10')
else:
  print('Your number was less than 10')
</code></pre>
      
      <div class="box">
        What do you think the output of the following program will be. Try it on your coputer.
      </div>
      
<pre><code class="language-python"># What is the output
num = 45

if a > 10:
  print('Your number was more than 10')
elif a > 20:
  print('Your number was more than 20')
elif a > 30:
  print('Your number was more than 30')
</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Blocks inside blocks</h2>
      So far we have been checking a single condition. But what if our we want to check another condition inside a block?
      You can always have a block inside another block. All you need is an extra <strong>tab</strong>.
      <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter2/inner-block.png" width="70%" class="image">
      
      <div class="box">
        You must be older than 10, and taller than 40" for a roller coaster ride.
        Write a program that asks someone for "age" and "height".
        Then prints out if that person can ride the roller coaster.
      </div>
      
      <h2>Complex conditions</h2>
      <p>
        If you have tried the roller coaster excersise, you may done it with two blocks (one inside the other).
        But thinking about it logically the only thing that you needed to do was to check if the age was more than 10
        <strong>AND</strong> the height was more than 40.
        Checking multiple conditions like that is very common in programming.
        That's why all the programming languages have <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong> operations beween booleans.
        Using these two opraions beween two boolean variable works exactly as they read.
        In Python we use <span class="inline-code">and</span> for AND between two booleans,
        and <span class="inline-code">or</span> for OR between two booleans
      </p>
      
<pre><code class="language-python"># Operation between booleans
# Check how here we use comments after the main Python command.
# Anything that we add after the # will be ignored by Python

b1 = 45 > 3  # This is True
b2 = "NP" == "New Providence"  # This is False

print(b1 and b2)  # will print False, because only one of them is True
print(b1 or b2)  # will print False, because one of them is true
</code></pre>
      <p>
        In the beginning it may be confusing to know what is the resutls when we have
        <span class="inline-code">and</span>, <span class="inline-code">or</span> between two booleans.
        This table is good guide.
      </p>
      <h1>LOGIC TABLE HERE</h1>
      
      <p>
        Now we can easily write our roller coaster check program like this:
      </p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># Roller coaster
# Notice the use of one function inside the other
# This puts the output from one function directly inside the other

age = int(input('What is your age? '))
height = int(input('What is your height in inches? '))

# See the use of brackets, remember how we used them in the previous lesson
if (age > 10) and (height > 40):
  print('Enjoy the roller coaster')
else:
  print('Sorry you can not ride')
</code></pre>
      <p>
        As you see in the above example, the brackets around the boolean variables act in the exact same way as they do in arithmetic ones.
        So, if there is a complex condition, feel free to use brackets as needed to make sure you get the right combination.
        As a practice, see if you can predict the outcomes printed out from this code.
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># What do you think the output is?
bv1 = (67 > 45) and ("this" != "that")
bv2 = (((5 * 7) - 45) > 13) or bv1
print(bv1, bv2)
</code></pre>
      
      <div class="box">
