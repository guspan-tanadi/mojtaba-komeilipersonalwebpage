      <h1>Branches</h1>
      <p>
        Often in a program it happens that the <strong>flow</strong> of your program depends on certain conditions.
        This is where branches come in.
      </p>
      
      <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter2/branches.jpeg" width="60%" class="image">
      <p>
        Branches are also known as the <span class="inline-code">if-else</span> conditions, because that's literally what happens in branching:
        A branch is a point in a program where there is a decision to make, based on which the flow of the program will be determined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a program that asks for your age and then tells you how old you are
        (not very useful, I know, but bare will me a bit).
        The code for such program will be something like this:
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># A program that tells you how old you are, but asks you that first.
age = input('How old are you? ')
print('You are ' + age + ' years olds.')
print('Have a nice day. Bye!')</code></pre>
      
      <p>
        Python will read your program line by line and executes each line.
        So, this is how your program <strong>flow</strong> look likes:
      </p>

      <h3>Change of flow</h3>
      <p>
        Now let's turn this into a program that does something slightly more useful:
        It asks your age, and then it tells you if you are eligible to vote
        (let's assume the legal age for voting is 18).
        Obviously we need something that has two separate paths.
        One of them tells you "Yes, you are" <i>if</i> the age you typed in is more than 18,
        and the other one that tells you "No, you aren't" otherwise.
      </p>
      
      <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter2/conditioned-flow.png" width="70%" class="image">
      
      <p>
        As you can see in the image above there are two flows for the program.
        Here is where the <strong>conditional statements</strong> come in.
        Conditional statemenet depend on an <i>statement</i> being <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>.
        In Python, as in other porgramming languages,
        we use the methematical equality and inequality signs to make these statemenets.
        The proper way to read the mathematical expressions made from the above is through using them with this table.
      </p>
      <div>
        <table style="width:50%">
          <tr>
            <th>Symbol</th>
            <th>Meaning</th> 
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> == </td>
            <td>Equal</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> > </td>
            <td>Greater than</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> => </td>
            <td>Greater than or equal</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> < </td>
            <td>Less than</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> =< </td>
            <td>Less than or equal</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        For example, we read <span class="inline-code">7 > 32</span> like this: "7 is greater than 32".
        Obviously, this is not correct, whic mean that this statement is <span class="inline-code">False</span>.
        Try this in Python as see if it agrees:
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Logical statements in Python
print(7 > 32)</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Boolean</h3>
      <p>
        Remember the variables that we introdued before?
        There is another VERY important variable type called <strong>boolean</strong>.
        Booleans can only take two values <span class="inline-code">False</span> or <span class="inline-code">True</span>.
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Boolean values
BooleanValue = True
print(BooleanValue)</code></pre>
      
      <p>
        As you may imagine there is not much appeal in having boolean variables on their own.
        But their importance becomse clear when we go back to the conditional statements that we talked about.
        In fact, what changes the flow of a program is often a boolean variable being
        <span class="inline-code">False</span> or <span class="inline-code">True</span>.
