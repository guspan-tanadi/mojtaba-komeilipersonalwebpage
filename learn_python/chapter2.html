      <h1>Branches</h1>
      Often in a program it happens that the <strong>flow</strong> of your program depends on certain conditions.
      This is where branches come in.
      <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter2/branches.jpeg" width="60%" class="image">
      Branches are also known as the <span class="inline-code">if-else</span> conditions, because that's literally what happens in branching:
      A branch is a point in a program where there is a decision to make, based on which the flow of the program will be determined.
      There is a program that asks for your age and then tells you how old you are
      (not very useful, I know, but bare will me a bit).
      The code for such program will be something like this:
<pre><code class="language-python"># A program that tells you how old you are, but asks you that first.
age = input('How old are you? ')
print('You are ' + age + ' years olds.')
print('Have a nice day. Bye!')</code></pre>
      
      Python will read your program line by line and executes each line.
      So, this is how your program <strong>flow</strong> look likes:

      <h3>Change of flow</h3>
      Now imagine we want a program that does something slightly more useful:
      It asks your age, and then it tells you if you are eligible to vote
      (let's assume the legal age for voting is 18).
      Obviously we need something that has two separate paths.
      One of them tells you "Yes, you are" <i>if</i> the age you typed in is more than 18,
      and the other one that tells you "No, you aren't" otherwise.

      As you can see in the image above there are two flows for the proram.
      Here is where the conditional statements come in.
      Conditional statemenet depend on an <i>statement</i> being <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>.
