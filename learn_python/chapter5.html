    <h1>Using Python better</h1>
    <p>
      In the previous chapter we briefly talked about the internal (built-in) objects of Python and their functions.
      In this chapter we dive deeper into these objects and talk more about the functions from these objects.
      We also introduce a couple of more objects that helps us use Python more effectively.

      We are going to do some <i>data processing</i> in this chapter.
      This means that you will write functions that in their input recieve some data, and produce some output.
      For that reason, we start with knowing Python functinos better, then we work on series of questions that recieves input and return outputs.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      We learned about the functions earlier in Chapter 2.
      Remember that functions <i>could</i> receive inputs and return outputs.
      For example
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Simple functions

def subtract(a, b):
  # This is a simple function that subtracts two numbers
  return a - b

# This is how we use this function.
answer = add(8, 5)
print(answer)
</code></pre>

    <h3>Named arguments</h3>
    <p>
      So far we have mostly used the functions as the above:
      inserting the inputs to the function (which we call arguments or parameters) in the order they are expected.
      There is another very common way for doing this.
      You can directly assign values to the input arguments by their names.
      For better illustration of that try to guess the output of the following code, then try it in Python.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def subtract(a, b):
  # This is a simple function that subtracts two numbers
  return a - b

# Using function with named arguments
answer = add(b=8, a=5)
print(answer)
</code></pre>

    <h3>Default arguments</h3>
    Python allows you to have functions with default values for their arguments.
    This means that you don't have to always provide all the arguments to a function.
    In fact, you have been usig these functions since the beginning without knowing it.
    Check the arguments for <span class="inline-code">print</span> function
    <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/print"  target="_blank">here</a>.

    <p>
      You can also define your own functions with the default values.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def subtract(a, b=0):
  # This is a simple function that subtracts two numbers
  # The second number has a default value.
  return a - b

# This is how we use this function.
print(add(12))
print(add(a=5))
print(add(a=5, b=2))
</code></pre>
