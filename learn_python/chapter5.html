    <h1>Using Python better</h1>
    <p>
      In the previous chapter we briefly talked about the internal (built-in) objects of Python and their functions.
      In this chapter we dive deeper into these objects and talk more about the functions from these objects.
      We also introduce a couple of more objects that helps us use Python more effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are going to do some <i>data processing</i> at the end of this chapter.
      This means that you will write functions that in their input recieve some data, and produce some output.
      For that reason, we start with knowing Python functinos better, then we work on series of questions that recieves input and return outputs.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      We learned about the functions earlier in Chapter 2.
      Remember that functions <i>could</i> receive inputs and return outputs.
      For example
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Simple functions

def subtract(a, b):
  # This is a simple function that subtracts two numbers
  return a - b

# This is how we use this function.
answer = subtract(8, 5)
print(answer)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      3
    </div>

    <h3>Named arguments</h3>
    <p>
      So far we have mostly used the functions as the above:
      inserting the inputs to the function (which we call arguments or parameters) in the order they are expected.
      There is another very common way for doing this.
      You can directly assign values to the input arguments by their names.
      For better illustration of that try to guess the output of the following code, then try it in Python.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def subtract(a, b):
  # This is a simple function that subtracts two numbers
  return a - b

# Using function with named arguments
answer = subtract(b=8, a=5)
print(answer)
</code></pre>

    <h3>Default arguments</h3>
    Python allows you to have functions with default values for their arguments.
    This means that you don't have to always provide all the arguments to a function.
    In fact, you have been usig these functions since the beginning without knowing it.
    Check the arguments for <span class="inline-code">print</span> function
    <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/print"  target="_blank">here</a>.

    <p>
      You can also define your own functions with the default values.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def subtract(a, b=0):
  # This is a simple function that subtracts two numbers
  # The second number has a default value.
  return a - b

# This is how we use this function.
print(subtract(12))
print(subtract(a=5))
print(subtract(a=5, b=2))
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      12
      <br>
      5
      <br>
      3
    </div>

    <h2>String</h2>
    <p>
      We are familiar with <span class="inline-code">String</span> types from Chapter 1.
      We have used some simple functions from the <span class="inline-code">String</span> objects,
      for example, <span class="inline-code">lower</span> and <span class="inline-code">upper</span>,
      which return the same <span class="inline-code">String</span> with all its characters in <i>lower</i> or <i>upper</i> case, respectively.
      We are going to learn more useful functions from the <span class="inline-code">String</span> object here.
    </p>
    <h3>Substring</h3>
    <p>
      To many of the functions that work with  <span class="inline-code">String</span> objects in Python,
      we first need to what is <strong>substring</strong>.
      A substring is a part of a <span class="inline-code">String</span> that can be a <span class="inline-code">count</span> on its own.
      For example, "side" is substring of "re<span style="color: red;">side</span>nce".
      Similarly, "ve ca" is  substring of "I ha<span style="color: red;">ve ca</span>ts and they are cute."
      But as far as python knows "new" is NOT a substring of "New providence" because for Python "new" and "New" are two different strings.
    </p>
    <h3>String index</h3>
    <p>
      So far we have seen Python strigns as a single entity. But in fact each string is like a lit of characters.
      As any other list the objects inside it have index (Don't forget that this index starts from 0, not 1).
    </p>
    <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter5/StringIndex.png" width="60%" class="image">
    <p>
      Therefore, you can use the same indexing number we used for lists in Python with strings.
      Try finding out the output of the following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># String index
# Indexing for a list
my_list = [6, 7, 8, 9]
print(my_list[3])

my_string = "carrots"
print(my_string[2])
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      8
      <br>
      r
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">count</span></h3>
    <p>
      Use this function for counting the number substring in a Python string.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Using the count function
S = "I can not have an apple."
# This will return 2 because of "an" substrings in "can" and "an"
print(S.count("an"))
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      2
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">find</span></h3>
    This function returns the index of the first occurance of a substring inside your string,
    if the substring exits. If it doesn't, it returns -1.
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Using the find function
S = "I can not have an apple."
print(S.find("have"))

# This will return -1, meaning the substring we are looking for is not in this string
print(S.find("cat"))
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      10
      <br>
      -1
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">replace</span></h3>
    <p>
      As the name suggests, this function replace one substring in your string with anothre.
      Going through the following example will clarify this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Replacing substrings
S = "I have a dog. I think dogs are the best."

# We are creating a new string after replacing the substring
S2 = S.replace("dog", "cat")
print(S2)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      I have a cat. I think cats are the best.
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">split</span></h3>
    <p>
      This function is different from all the string object functions we talked about so far.
      It returns a list of strings made from <i>splitting</i> the original substring by some substring.
      If the substring does not exist in the original string, then it returns the original string as single item in the retruned list.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter5/split.png" width="60%" class="image">

    <p>
      Example of how to use the <span class="inline-code">split</span> function.
      Notice how we use the string function differently in the example below?
      So far we have been creating a string object first,
      and then calling that with the function that we needed.
      But we don't have to do that; we can directly use any of these functions on a string.
      In fact what happens here is that Python creates an anonymous object for you.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Splitting the string into a list of its substrings
splitted_parts = "cat, dog , chickens , good,boy".split(",")
print(splitted_parts)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      ['cat', ' dog ', ' chickens ', ' good', 'boy']
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      Sometimes using the <span class="inline-code">split</span> function makes left over space before and after the returned strings.
      For example, <span class="inline-code">"Hello, I am here".split(",")</span> returns
      <span class="inline-code">["Hello", " I am here"]</span>. As you see the second strin has an extra space in front of it.
      There is a function called <span class="inline-code">strip()</span> that returns a string in which the extra spaces,
      before and after the string are removed.
      Think about how you can remove all the extra spaces from the returned strigns in the list.
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">join</span></h3>
    <p>
      This function is the opposite of the <span class="inline-code">split</span> function.
      It <i>joins</i> the strings inside a lits into a single string, by putting another string between them.
      So in summary it turns a list of strings into a single string.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter5/join.png" width="75%" class="image">
    <p>
      An example of using <span class="inline-code">join</span> function.
      See how we used it in two different ways this time too.
      Once with creating an string and using it for join, and the other time with using a string directly.
      The results are exactly the same. Choose based on your own preference.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># Joining strings

my_animals = ["cats", "dogs", "squirels"]

# method 1
join_string = " are cute. "
print(join_string.join(my_animals))

# method 2
print(" are cute. ".join(my_animals))
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      cats are cute. dogs are cute. squirels
      <br>
      cats are cute. dogs are cute. squirels
    </div>

    <h2>List</h2>
    <p>
      Now let's talk about another important built-in object in Python: <strong>list</strong>.
      We already introduced <span class="inline-code">append</span> and <span class="inline-code">count</span>.
      Remember that the first one is adds an element to the end of the string,
      and the latter latter counts the number of occurances of an element inside the list.
      Have a quick look at chapter 3 to refresh your mind on these two functions.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># list functions: append and count

my_favorite_numbers = [5, 6, 3, 4]

# append
my_favorite_numbers.append(6)
print("My favorite numbers are", my_favorite_numbers)

# count number 6s in the list
print(my_favorite_numbers.count(6))
</code></pre>
    <div class="output-box">
      My favorite numbers are [5, 6, 3, 4, 6]
      <br>
      2
    </div>
