    <h1>More Modules</h1>
    <p>
      In the previous chapter you used you saw how packages are built in Python.
      You also built and imported a module that you had made yourself.
      The power of using Python modules is that you can import modules that are built by others.
      Often these packages are accumulation of many years of work by a large army of engineers.
      Python has thousands of <i>free</i> packages that you can use to make your own impressive programms.
      In this chapter we see a very quick introduction to a couple of packages that helps you build cool applications.
    </p>
    <h2>Google Colab</h2>
    <p>
      For this chapter we are going to use a very powerful tool for writing and testign Python code quickly.
      Google <strong>Colab</strong> is a category of softwares known as <strong>notebooks</strong>.
      They help you write a program in small units called cells, and run them together.
      They also help you have other things along with your code.
      You can include pictures, movies and of course notes in a botebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step to use Colab is having a Google account and being logged in.
      Then go to the following address:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">https://colab.research.google.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you should see the Colab first page that in October 2022, looks like the following image.
      Notice that if you have logged in your browser, you should see your Google profile image in the top right corner;
      as you see mine here.
    </p>

    <h2>Simple code</h2>
    <p>
      Now use the file menu that you see here to create a "New notebook".
      You see the following page for a new notebook.
      You can click on the name of the notebook (that might be <i>Untitled</i> now) to rename your notebook.
      Feel free to rename your notebook to something more reasonable.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter4/StarterCell.png" width="90%" class="image">
    <p>
      Your new notebook has a single empty cell in it.
      You can click on <strong>+Code</strong> on the top bar to add a new cell.
      You can type code inside a cell like you did in a file.
      When you press <strong>Shift + Enter</strong> keys togther,
      or pressing the play button on the left side of the cell.
    </p>
    <div class="box">
      Write a program that counts (prints out) from 1 to 10 in a single cell and run it.
    </div>
    <h2>Python Packages</h2>
    <p>
      You imported and used some Python modules that comes out of the box with Python before
      (remember importing <i>random</i> and <i>math</i>).
      Colab comes with some extra external Python packages that are included for easily importing modules.
      There remains thousands of other packages that you can install on your computer for Python to use.
      We are going to start by installing a useful and easy to use Python package:
      <a href="https://huggingface.co" target="_blank">Hugging Face</a>.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter4/HF.png" width="20%" class="image">
    <p>
      Run this in cell to install the huggingface package.
    </p>
    <div class="colab-cell">
      ! pip install transformers
    </div>
    <p>
      You will see the output of the cell and the steps to install this package.
      And at the end you must see the message that tells you the install was successful.
      Now we are ready to make some pretty cool Artifical Intelligence with Python.
    </p>

    <h3>Read and respond</h3>
    <p>
      The first thing we want to try with the Hugging Face package we installed is building something that can
      translate.
      Here we are using two cells, as you see in the screenshot below.
      The first cell imports the module and creates and object that does translation for us
      (this is the <i>en_fr_translator</i> object).
    </p>
    <p>
      In a notebook the objects and variables that you created in one cell will remain in notebook
      as long as you keep your notebook open. This means that you can use them in other cells of the notebook.
      And this is what we do in the second cell. We directly call the <i>en_fr_translator</i> object to do translation
      from English to French.
